      "question": "2. Given an op-amp who’s gain is unknown but the output is saturated, which of the following is not possible?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "No feedback is being applied",
        "b": "Negative feedback is applied while input is more than –V<sub>sat</sub>/A<sub>OL</sub>",
        "c": "Positive feedback is applied",
        "d": "Negative feedback is applied while the input is more than V<sub>sat</sub>/A<sub>OL</sub>"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Explanation 2",
        "b": "Explanation 1 : If op-amp is used without feedback or with positive feedback, the difference voltage VD will be large enough and hence op-amp can be considered to be in the saturation region. If op-amp is used with negative feedback then the input is smaller. Saturation of output occurs if the input is not between –VSat/AOL and +VSat/AOL.",

      "question": "3. What is incorrect regarding the output offset voltage of op-amp?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It is the output when the input voltage at both input pins of op-amp is zero",
        "b": "It occurs due to dissimilarities in the internal structure of the op-amp",
        "c": "The output offset voltage does not depend on the supply voltage",
        "d": "The output offset voltage can be in the units of Volts"

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Explanation 2",
        "b": "Explanation 2",
        "c": "Explanation 1 Output offset voltage is the output voltage of the op-amp when the input at both terminals is zero. It occurs due to the dissimilarities and mismatches in the internal structure of the op-amp. The value of output offset voltage is in volts. It varies with changes in supply voltage.",
