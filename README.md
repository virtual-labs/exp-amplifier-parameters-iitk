### About the Experiment 

The operational amplifier (Op-Amp) is a key building block in many electronic circuits, and its performance is characterized by several key parameters. Here is a brief description of the measurement of some of these parameters:<br>
1. Common mode gain (CM gain): The common mode gain of an Op-Amp is the ratio of the output voltage to the input voltage for a common mode input signal. The common mode input is defined as a signal that is applied to both inputs of the Op-Amp with the same voltage level. To measure the CM gain, a balanced differential input signal is applied to the Op-Amp, and the output is measured with a differential probe.<br>
2. Differential mode gain (DM gain): The differential mode gain of an Op-Amp is the ratio of the output voltage to the difference between the two input signals. To measure the DM gain, an unbalanced differential input signal is applied to the Op-Amp, and the output is measured with a differential probe.<br>
3. Common mode rejection ratio (CMMR): The common mode rejection ratio (CMMR) is a measure of the Op-Amp's ability to reject common mode signals. It is defined as the ratio of the differential mode gain to the common mode gain. A high CMMR indicates good common mode rejection and is essential in many applications where a differential input signal is required.<br>
4. Slew rate: The slew rate of an Op-Amp is a measure of its ability to change its output voltage quickly in response to changes in its input voltage. It is defined as the maximum rate of change of the output voltage with respect to time and is usually expressed in volts per microsecond (V/μs). A high slew rate indicates that the Op-Amp can respond quickly to fast changes in its input, which is important in high-speed applications such as audio and video signals.<br>

These measurements are typically performed with specialized test equipment, such as oscilloscopes and signal generators. The exact procedure for measuring each parameter can vary depending on the particular Op-Amp and the test equipment being used.
